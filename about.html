          Sociedad (formally: Las Altas Sociedades) is a start-up clothing company that
          produces high-quality designs and layouts for clothes that fits everyone's taste
          in contemporary fashion. Sociedad's first ever store will be located at Shoe Market
          in Marikina City SM Marikina, near Riverbanks Center. Sociedad aims to build a
          brand name that in itself will sell and market its own hopefully, in the future,
          getting to a point where the brand name, SOCIEDAD, will be synonymous to clothing.
          This goal, however, is just one of the many expansions for the business currently
          under planning. We also plan to expand into other regions in Marikina City, after which
          we'll expand into the sorrounding cities, which will then open up the potential
          to expand to the whole Metro Manila Region.
        </p> <br>
        <p class="aboutpara">
          These goals and this future we envision, nevertheless, will not be possible if one
          will not have humble beginnings. Sociedad was founded mid-2019 when one of founders
          saw the potential among individuals who has the creativity to create something
          truly wonderful. He made a list of these individuals, observed them and gathered
          them together thus forming the group. The group later will be called <b>Sociedad</b>,
          after the spanish word for <i>society</i>. The name means that these individuals
          has the capabilities to run, manage, and lead a society in perfection, without a flaw,
          but can not since no one in the group realizes what they can do when they are working
          together for a cause. . . Of course the founder know what they can do together
          when unhindered by the very thing they were named after and thus the name Sociedad stuck,
          serving as a reminder of the things they can accomplish and what power they can have
          provided the situation.
        </p> <br>
        <p class="aboutpara">
          Of course they have to prove it themselves first, and with that, LAS was created.
