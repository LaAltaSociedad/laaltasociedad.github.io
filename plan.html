        <h1 class="top-title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p class="standard-text">Las Altas Sociedades launched this business in order to gain
          advantage of the internet dependency of the public since it is
          easy to advertise the business and the product online through
          social media and with the help of personalized ads on social
          media platforms together with the tools it comes with, it is certain
          that the campaign that we will launch will reach the target market
          for the business.
        </p> <br>
        <p class="standard-text">It might seem counterintuitive to spend a lot of money on
          advertising the product and the business to gain more profit but it
          is necessary to achieve the level of recognition that is necessary to
          achieve the goals of the company toturn its customers into regular
          customers and to have its brand name known and be
          synonymous to clothing. Other clothing company restricts their
          customers to a certain range of designs that does not tailor to the
          needs and goals of the customer of buying their products in the
          first place. Here at Sociedad, we acknowledge that every
          individual wants their clothes to be unique and to reflect their own
          personality therefore we give our beloved customers the freedom
          to pick, choose, and match the designs they want and need.
        </p> <br>
        <p class="standard-text">With the ongoing pandemic, selling our products physically will
          be a tough challenge but still is possible, doable, and achievable
          by adhering to the policies and guidelines set about by the
          national and local governments and by following closely to the
          development of the events making adjustments when the
          management see fit. To aid with this, we are also launching an
          online store that would accommodate our customers with the
          same enthusiasm and passion that we do physically in order to
          make them feel comfortable. This can be achieved by fast
          responses on our social media accounts, e-mails, and on online
          stores. We want it to be as intuitive as possible to give the customers
          the best experience that they deserve within our store.</p>

        <h1 class="sub-title">COMPANY</h1>
        <p class="standard-text">Sociedad is a start-up retail establishment started in 2018 that sells its own
          clothing line to younger generations and adults alike. Sociedad will be
          situated at Shoe Market at Marikina City with further plans to expand into
          other locations as the business grow and moreand morepeople recognize
          the brand. There are also plans to build and establish an online presence
          by building online shops where people can browse our catalog and buy
          our products or order for our printing services. We envision the business to
          be a recognizable brand name after some time in the market and have
          the brand name Sociedad be a common word synonymous with clothing
          specifically with tops both for men and women.

        <p class="standard-text">
          -The market for clothing in the Philippines is tough to penetrate due to the
          nature of high-profiting companies’ tendencies to collaborate with each
          other therefore burying other smaller clothing businesses into oblivion. The
          proposed solution to this is to collaborate with other smaller brands that
          adheres to the visions and goals of Sociedad to gain a lead and to gain
          the public’s support for the local industry. We will promote and market our
          products and the business with striving determination in a way that always
          considers the reaction of the public. Utilizing the social media as a medium
          for our promotional campaign in these times of pandemic, we envision the
          opening to be grand complete with fun events and freebies that will
          promote the business even more through advertising of our product and
          hopefully turn customers into regular customers of the brand. We will do this
          throughout the year to ensure that the brand gets recognized and known
          by the public and reach a place where the brand advertises its own self.
          Funds for these marketing campaign will be gathered from the business’
          revenue reserving 20% of the monthly revenue in its first months gradually
          decreasing to a range of five [5%] to ten percent [10%] adjusted as the
          management see fit.

          -The market for clothing is very profitable due to the rise of current fashion
          trends and because this is one of the basic needs of humansto survive. The
          need to belong and to be part of something drives people to jump into
          trends making it a great strategy for the market to exploit. With that said, it
          is tough to compete with high-level brands and companies within the
          clothing industry but because of its high-profitability, it is certain that
          everyone has their own place in the industry.
