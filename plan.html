      <h1 class="standtitle">INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <p class="state black">Las Altas Sociedades launched this business in order to gain
        advantage of the internet dependency of the public since it is
        easy to advertise the business and the product online through
        social media and with the help of personalized ads on social
        media platforms together with the tools it comes with, it is certain
        that the campaign that we will launch will reach the target market
        for the business.
      </p> <br>
      <p class="state black">It might seem counterintuitive to spend a lot of money on
        advertising the product and the business to gain more profit but it
        is necessary to achieve the level of recognition that is necessary to
        achieve the goals of the company toturn its customers into regular
        customers and to have its brand name known and be
        synonymous to clothing. Other clothing company restricts their
        customers to a certain range of designs that does not tailor to the
        needs and goals of the customer of buying their products in the
        first place. Here at Sociedad, we acknowledge that every
        individual wants their clothes to be unique and to reflect their own
        personality therefore we give our beloved customers the freedom
        to pick, choose, and match the designs they want and need.
      </p> <br>
      <p class="state black">With the ongoing pandemic, selling our products physically will
        be a tough challenge but still is possible, doable, and achievable
        by adhering to the policies and guidelines set about by the
        national and local governments and by following closely to the
        development of the events making adjustments when the
        management see fit. To aid with this, we are also launching an
        online store that would accommodate our customers with the
        same enthusiasm and passion that we do physically in order to
        make them feel comfortable. This can be achieved by fast
        responses on our social media accounts, e-mails, and on online
        stores. We want it to be as intuitive as possible to give the customers
        the best experience that they deserve within our store.</p>

      <h1 class="standtitle">STRATEGY AND <br>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
      <p class="state black">
        -The market for clothing in the Philippines is tough to penetrate due to the
        nature of high-profiting companies’ tendencies to collaborate with each
        other therefore burying other smaller clothing businesses into oblivion. The
        proposed solution to this is to collaborate with other smaller brands that
        adheres to the visions and goals of Sociedad to gain a lead and to gain
        the public’s support for the local industry. We will promote and market our
        products and the business with striving determination in a way that always
        considers the reaction of the public. Utilizing the social media as a medium
        for our promotional campaign in these times of pandemic, we envision the
        opening to be grand complete with fun events and freebies that will
        promote the business even more through advertising of our product and
        hopefully turn customers into regular customers of the brand. We will do this
        throughout the year to ensure that the brand gets recognized and known
        by the public and reach a place where the brand advertises its own self.
        Funds for these marketing campaign will be gathered from the business’
        revenue reserving 20% of the monthly revenue in its first months gradually
        decreasing to a range of five [5%] to ten percent [10%] adjusted as the
        management see fit.

      <h1 class="standtitle">MARKET ANALYSIS</h1>
      <p class="state black">
        -The market for clothing is very profitable due to the rise of current fashion
        trends and because this is one of the basic needs of humansto survive. The
        need to belong and to be part of something drives people to jump into
        trends making it a great strategy for the market to exploit. With that said, it
        is tough to compete with high-level brands and companies within the
        clothing industry but because of its high-profitability, it is certain that
        everyone has their own place in the industry.
